This folder contains experimental plugins and other stuff not yet ready to be built fix into StreamBuffRe itself.

BEWARE: Before using any of them back up your settings.ini to prevent data loss!


Using plugins requires a full license.


How to use plugins:
0. Close StreamBuffRe
1. Create (if not already existing) a folder called plugins in your settings folder ( https://streambuffre.com/support/#DefaultSettingsDirectory ).
2. Copy one of the .dll files here into the plugins folder.
3. Start StreamBuffRe
That's it.

Keep in mind: Removing a plugin will automatically remove all its settings.
